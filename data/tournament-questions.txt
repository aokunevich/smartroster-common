3.3 Pairings
Your opponent for your first game will be
randomly determined. Subsequent rounds
will pair players by the following criteria:
- By record (i.e. the number of
wins, losses and draws)
- By win path (i.e. the timing of the
rounds in which a player won or
lost their games)
- Randomly within players of the
same ranking
If you ever find yourself facing off against
a player you have faced previously please
contact a member of the events team



Step 1. Muster Armies
Your army should not exceed 2000 points
and should be chosen before the event.
Your army roster must be uploaded to the
Best Coast Pairings app before the start of
Round 1. You will be emailed out a link to
the Best Coast Pairings sign up page before
the event.


Step 2. Determine Mission
Your deployment for each mission, the
Mission Rules and the Primary Mission
Rules will be pre-selected. These will be
emailed out to players at least one week
before the event.



tep 14. Determine the Victor
Follow the rules laid out in Step 14 to
determine the victor. At the end of each
game you and your opponent will need
to record your results on the Best Coast
Pairings website or on an event scorecard
(if required). When recording your scores
please enter how many points you scored
out of the 100 available.






3.5 Scoring
At the end of each game please input your
scores into Best Coast Pairings. These
will then be used to calculate the Best
General standings and the Best Overall
Standings.




3.5.1 Best General
The overall winner will be determined
by the number of victories achieved at
the event. Players will then be split by the
total amount of Victory Points achieved
during the event and then their Strength
of Schedule. If players are still tied the
following tie breakers will be used:
- Favourite Game votes
- Favourite Army votes




3.5.2 Best Overall
Our Best Overall winners will be
determined using our Throne of Skulls
system, which factors in gaming scores,
favourite army votes, and favourite player
votes. When you have submitted your
scores using Best Coast Pairings your
score will be converted to Tournament
points using the following system
- Victory - 3 points
- Draw - 1 point
- Loss - 0 points



Favourite Game – Vote for the two players
you enjoyed playing against the most (note
that you can’t vote for the same person
twice!). Maybe they displayed excellent
sportsmanship, perhaps they were positive
and friendly, or it was generally a fun and
engaging game.

Favourite Army – Vote for the two
armies you played against that you liked
the most (note that you can’t vote for
the same army twice!). An entertaining
or unique collection of units, excellent
painting standards, a fantastic centrepiece
model, spectacular conversions, or overall
complimentary theme may make up your
mind




3.5.4 Best Overall Score Example:
Edd has won four games and lost two
games earning a tournament score so far
of 12. He then receives three Favourite
Game votes and two Favourite Army
votes, which are added to the 12 points he
scored from his games for a total Overall
score of 30 out of a possible 54 points.
