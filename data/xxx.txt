**RULES M2.025-P01C01**

**1) Clarifications/Nomenclature**
> **Army:** The thing called “Order of Battle” as per Crusade, and “Roster” as per Administratum, shall be instead called as Army. This naming (in Architect’s opinion at least) is a better statement of what we are talking about instead of Faction, which is again another completely different category on Administratum and in the average mind as well. For example Chaos Knights is a Faction, but 2 separate rosters of it are not Factions themselves but Armies.
> **General:** A character impersonated by a Player. Generals are the head of Armies, they communicate in-character with the other Armies’ Generals.
> **Solo General:** A General who is not part of any Grand Alliance.
> **Grand Alliance:** A group of Generals who form some form of agreement on supporting, or at least not attacking each other.
> **Sector:** Planets are divided into different areas or territories, each with their unique facilities, flora, and fauna. These areas are called Sectors. Each Sector has 4 levels of control, representing an Army’s influence over said Sector, and the efficiency by which it can utilize its resources:
> - Level 0: The Army is not present in the territory, thus cannot defend it, nor utilize any of its benefits
> - Level 1: An Army that has this level of control has already some minimal presence in the territory, and said Army can mobilize to defend it from an invading force, or fight with another Army that has level 1-2 control in the same Sector
> - Level 2: An Army with this level of control can already utilize the Sector’s resources, benefiting from its Superficial Benefits
> - Level 3: An Army with level 3 control over a Sector can use its Total Benefits
> **Mobilization:** An Army moving on the map of a planet or between planets. Mobilization can be of either Reconnaissance, Attacking, or Defending nature, both having different requirements as per the Mobilization rules of this Crusade.

**2)  Army Composition**
> **2.1) Supply Limit**
> The Supply Limit shall advance as per the following for each Army:
> - The Starting Supply Limit for each Army is 1000 points.
> - The Supply Limit shall/can increase as per the following methods:
> - - After each Phase (5 Cycles) each Army gains 500 points to their Supply Limit
> - - “Increase Supply Limit” Requisition can be used, but it increases the limit only by 100 points for 1 RP
> - An Army joining the Crusade later shall have its Starting Supply Limit as the following: 1000+(Current Phase Number-1)*500 points. So joining in Phase 1 is 1000p, Phase 2 is 1500p, Phase 3 is 2000p, etc.



> **2.2) Limitations**
> - Global:
> - - For each 1000 points in an Army or Deployed Army in a Battle there can be only 1 of the following categories each:
> - - - A unit with the Legends Keyword
> - - - A unit with the Epic Hero Keyword
> - - - A unit with the Titanic Keyword (+1 for Imperial/Chaos Knights)
> - - - Note: A unit which has multiple of these keywords only counts as 1 of the above categories. That category has to be stated clearly.
> - Introduction of Epic Heroes:
> - - Epic Heroes only allowed in the Crusade if the General intending to utilize it provides a compelling narrative, detailing why that specific character of the 40K universe if there in the Vigilantia System
> - - - Any Epic Hero has to be renamed to fit the Army’s own narrative
> - - - In the case of Primarch-level characters (Angron, Magnus, Mortarion, Guilliman, Lion El’jonson, The Silent King, anything above 300p) either Architect or a server-poll shall make the decision
> - Faction-specific:
> - - Chaos and Imperial Knights
> - - - These factions have to take a minimum of 25% allies to each battle

**3) Vigilantia System Administration**
> **3.1) Phases**
> - Each Phase is made up of 5 consecutive Cycles
> - The purpose of the Phase is to mark a milestone in the Crusade both narratively and rules-wise, meaning:
> - - Significant rules shall not be modified while a Phase is ongoing, to allow too rapid rules changes, resulting in inconsistent experiences/results for players.
> - - For each Phase a narrative goal for each Solo General and Grand Alliance shall be determined. This can be suggested by the SG or GA, or can be assigned by the Rules Team.
> - - - In Phase 1 the narrative goal for each Army is to gain a solid foothold in the Vigilantia System.
> **3.2) Cycles**
> Each Cycle lasts 3 weeks in total, and is divided into 3 Stages
> - The Planning Stage:
> - - Week 1 Monday 00:00 (GMT+1) - Wednesday 20:00 (GMT+1)
> - - (State of Planetary Maps and System Map announced)
> - - Solo Generals and Grand Alliances strategize their actions and plan their moves
