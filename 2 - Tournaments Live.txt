Live Tournaments

Once the tournament status changes to “started,” a link to the Live page becomes available.
Since a tournament includes multiple games happening at the same time, this page allows you to track player progress.

A table is available showing overall player standings: placement, wins, draws, and losses.

You can also view detailed information for each individual game:Players, primary mission, total score. 

The score is broken down by round, including: secondary missions, points for each secondary mission, and points for the primary mission.

The information is updated in real time (via long polling).
