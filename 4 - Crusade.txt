Crusade

Some comments for you:“It’s more of a narrative campaign, where you set up an army roster and as games go on they earn honours, distinctions, and injuries based on how they fare.Think of it as a version with meta-progression and RPG elements compared to matched play’s pick-up, one-off games.”

Player will have multiple forces.

Each force has the following:
	•	Supply Limit
	•	Supply Used
	•	Battle Tally
	•	Victories
	•	Requisition Points
	•	Notes
