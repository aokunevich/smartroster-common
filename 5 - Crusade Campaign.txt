Crusade Campaign

This is a combination of a "Crusade" and a "Tournament". It involves playing many games over a long period of time—possibly several months—like a tournament, but using a single force, as in a Crusade, which progresses over time.

The idea is that there's a planet (or several planets, or a whole galaxy, etc.) being fought over. The planet is divided into sectors.

Each game is a battle for a sector.

After each game, the Campaign Master (CM) records the progress.
Here's my very rough draft to help you understand the concept:

Right now, I only have a vision from the CM's perspective.

There should be:

* A map with current progress.
* A campaign status log (date, short description), showing the current state. For example:

  * 01-01-2025: All players must finish their turns
  * 03-03-2025: Map state updated

* A player list (player, alliance, role, faction, timezone)
* Ability to add, remove, or update player information
* A list of player alliances (name, number of players)
* Ability to create, delete, or update alliances
* A list of past and upcoming games (name, winner, date)

Another difference from standard games is that the CM can create custom rules, missions, and more.

Here’s what should be possible to create/delete/edit:

* Primary missions
* Secondary missions
* Game rules
* Relics
* Ranks
* Battle traits
* Battle scars
